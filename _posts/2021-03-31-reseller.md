#Scheme 2
As a seller 
Manage reseller network 

- Onboard resellers 
- Manage drop-shipping communications and payments
- Fixed Fees - Income Share agreement 
    - Only pay when the networks monthly volume threshold is hit - say 50,000 
    - Only pay say 2% capped to 5K per month 
    
    Pay only when you go else use the tools for free 
    Say you process order worth 10000 you pay 0 fees 
    say you process 50000 - you pay 2% - 1000
    Say you process 1,50,000 - you pay 2%   - 3000 
    Say you process 250000 - you pay 2%  - 5000 
    Say you process anything above 250000 you still pay 5000
